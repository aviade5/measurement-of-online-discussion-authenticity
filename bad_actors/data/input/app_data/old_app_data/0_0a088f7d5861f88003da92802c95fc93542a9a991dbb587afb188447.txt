There is a nice rotating collection of recipes. Looks like you can only save 3 recipes in favorites, but the recipes are authentic tasting. I learned a lot from the clicks to websites in it that brought me to interesting related areas.
it could use more recipes, the ones that i was turned on by look to be good quality recipes and good directions, i have had trouble getting the app to work properly a couple of times.
Italian food is my favourite, now I have a pasta maker its easy to follow recipes and produce fresh Italian foods.
There wasn't one recipe that I would use and I removed it from my device as soon as I could.
I like it so far.
perfect
reminds me of recipes from my Mom and my Grandmother.looking forward to trying some of them. thank you for asking
This one is ok but I don't find myself using it much. I don't find it easy to use. That doesn't mean that it's no good, it just means it doesn't appeal to me.
THis app has only a few italian recipes in it and none that seem great to me. I was simply not excited. I will not buy anymore KINDLE cookbooks.
they were not the most popular recipes for italian cooking but I guess for something different to make when you have extra time it might be ok
No bueno, not too much to choose from and nothing new or exciting. I thought it was a cook bookm but it is just recipes from random people.
easy to follow, gives me ideas for variations. love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it.
I hope it will be good because I am Italian and never tried this app before so hope the best
