Another book that does not really help simplify the diet. I am a person who does not need all the small points, just give me the diet, the menu and a shopping list. Why make things so complicated? It just discourages people from doing the diet with all the chapter, upon chapters about scientific reasons why this diet works.
WORTHLESS I DELETED IT
An app with a motive, they want to sell their own product. But I don't care, they do actually give atkins info and I enjoyed reading it.
I really don't want to give even 1 star or even a half star. Louder app. Nonfunctional.?
Problem with moving from one part to another and with closing out without locking out.
I love Atkins because It teaches you how it eat in and practice portion control
It was a good read if you already know the plan and want to get reacquainted.
The real deal. Not someone's own version to sell their own book.
Good info without having to plod through Dr Adkins whole book.
I don't think it is any better than anything else ...
I did not get a real meal plan
Great help. I really enjoy it.

It was quick and easy, and my started kit arrived very fast...really happy with the whole process!
It gave me much information that I had forgotten. So it was good to reunite with the facts.
This book has been extremely helpful for my journey with the atkins diet experience.
Great information. I started my plan the minute I got the package.
