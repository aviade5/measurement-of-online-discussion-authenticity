It seems unstable and won't load when my tablet starts up. Even when I went to just a solid color wallpaper, it still tries to load...always unsuccessfully. I need to delete it.
just slows things down, not a very good app at all if i where you i wouldn't waste my time with it
Love it
This program did not work well, I finally uninstalled as I got tired of the notice. Would not buy again?
I got myself a smart phone a while back. Needless to say, I was (and still am) like a kid with a new toy. I was amazed st the variety of apps out there, and especially at The "live wallpaper.This set of bubbles is delightful to watch. I enjoy watching them change colors and collide with them.It's been said that watching fish in an aquarium can lower one's blood pressure. While I don't know how scientifically that can be proven, I can say that watching these bubbles float around can make me feel calmer.It's a fun wallpaper to have.
Because I can't give ZERO stars...after 3 tries, it still failed to download. Turning phone off/on didn't work; not sure what's up...
