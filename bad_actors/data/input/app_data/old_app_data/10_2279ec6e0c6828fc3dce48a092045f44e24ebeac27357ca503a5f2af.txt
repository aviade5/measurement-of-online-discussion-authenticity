Plays tunes stored on your device (not the cloud) - perfect for Kindle Fire HD when out of range of wireless, or when web access is blocked via FreeTime.
Most apps put their ads inside the app. This one sends them to your notification area so that even when the app is closed, ads can still appear. Aggravating. As soon as I find an app that will pull in music from all folders, like this one does, I'll move on.
Not what I wanted. Just needed a .wav file player to play my email attached voicemail messages on my Kindle Fire. Picus Wav Player is the right tool.
A simple MP3 player that plays files in a fold. That's all I need.Job well done, Mr. Beat.Z
If you need an MP3 player that will play just the songs in your folder of random favorites, this is the app for you! The clean looking interface and apperance controls set this player ahead. Extra thumbs up for being able to control the banner ads as well. The only thing holding this app back from complete perfection is the (apparent) lack of album art support (for now). Also:expense try the "woodish" theme, it's excellent!
I had to de-install it. Wrong play order for classical music movements imported from CD. No way to change the order.
